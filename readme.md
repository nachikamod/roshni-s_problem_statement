# Done !!!


Well as I said four different languages and I kept my promise. Uh telling about the development well python (Took me <20 min), c++ ( < 5min ) and javascript( > 30 min ) was not challenging enough as you can see I aminly used 
inbuit functions and libararies in this languages. 

Even though I would like to mention that most challenging was developing it with c. It was insanely awesome **Just like you LOL**.

Because, 

1. I tried to devlope it without any external library (Except stdio, stdlib hahahaha....)
2. It is developed using queue-using linked list. (Secret I really suck at pointers)
3. I was so idiot that I waisted my 2 hours thinking that this problem needs to be solved using stack and not queue cause I think you said **LIFO** but yeh atlast I figured it out
   its not **LIFO** its **FIFO**

At the end c was fun. I tried to be little bit creative with javascript, wich is really not a creativity at its finest I thought of, cause I wanted to have a sleep too (It was alomost 3:00 AM I guess 3:30 AM oh wahtever)

**Iske bad msg karne ki jurrat bhi mat karna tujhe bola tha na either selfie nahi to direct sunday ko bat karna.......................Grrrrr**
